            <h2>Key Components of a Computer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong> - The CPU, or "brain" of the computer, executes instructions and processes data for all tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Motherboard</strong> - The motherboard connects all components and facilitates communication between them.</li>
                <li><strong>RAM (Memory)</strong> - RAM provides temporary storage for data in use, allowing quick access for the CPU.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage (HDD/SSD)</strong> - Storage holds all data and files, including the operating system, even when the computer is off.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</strong> - The PSU converts and distributes power to all computer parts, ensuring stable operation.</li>
                <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</strong> - The GPU handles graphics rendering, essential for gaming, video editing, and 3D tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Input and Output Devices (I/O)</strong> - I/O devices allow users to interact with the computer and view results.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A computer is composed of a number of basic parts that cooperate to process information and carry out operations. The central processing unit, or CPU, serves as the computer's "brain," carrying out computations and executing commands. The motherboard, a circuit board that connects all the parts and enables effective communication, is attached to it. RAM, or memory, makes multitasking easier and faster by temporarily storing data that the CPU needs to access quickly.</p>

            <p>Data and files, including the operating system and software programs, are permanently stored on storage devices such as hard disks or solid-state drives. The power supply unit ensures steady power by distributing electricity to every component of the computer. Cooling devices, like fans and heatsinks, prevent overheating by regulating temperature during intensive use. Graphics processing units are responsible for rendering visuals, which is essential for tasks like gaming and graphic design.</p>

            <p>Lastly, data presentation and user interaction are enabled via input and output devices. Output devices, such as printers and monitors, display or print results, while input devices like keyboards and mice allow users to send commands to the computer. Some computers also feature optical drives that can read and write CDs or DVDs. Together, these components create a responsive and interactive system that supports modern computing tasks.</p>
