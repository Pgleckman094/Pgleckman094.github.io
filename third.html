                1. Gather Components and Prepare Workspace
                Start by gathering all necessary components: case, motherboard, CPU, CPU cooler, RAM, storage (SSD/HDD), GPU (if needed), PSU, and cables. Have a screwdriver ready, and ensure you're working in a clean, static-free area to prevent damage to sensitive components.

                2. Install the CPU, Cooler, and RAM
                Open the CPU socket on the motherboard, insert the CPU, and secure it by closing the latch. Attach the CPU cooler, either using the included thermal paste or applying a small dot yourself. Next, align the RAM stick with the slot on the motherboard and press it in until it clicks into place

                3. Mount the Motherboard, Storage, PSU, and GPU
                Place the motherboard in the case and secure it with screws. Mount the SSD or HDD and connect it to the motherboard with a cable. Install the PSU, routing the necessary power cables to the motherboard and other components. If using a GPU, insert it into the PCIe slot and screw it in securely. Finally, connect all power cables and attach any case fans or front-panel connectors.

                4. Power On and Install the Operating System
                Connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, then power on the computer. Use a USB drive to install the operating system and complete the setup.
