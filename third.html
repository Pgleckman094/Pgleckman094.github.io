            <h2>How to Build:</h2>
            <ul>
                1. Get All Parts and Tools
Gather components: case, motherboard, CPU, CPU cooler, RAM, storage (SSD/HDD), GPU (if needed), PSU, and cables.
Have a screwdriver ready, and work in a clean, static-free area.
2. Install the CPU and Cooler
Open the CPU socket on the motherboard, insert the CPU, and close the latch.
Attach the CPU cooler, either using the included thermal paste or applying a small dot yourself.
3. Insert RAM
Line up the RAM stick with the slot on the motherboard and press it in until it clicks.
4. Mount the Motherboard in the Case
Place the motherboard in the case and screw it into place.
5. Install Storage
Mount the SSD or HDD in the case and connect it to the motherboard with a cable.
6. Add the Power Supply (PSU)
Secure the PSU in the case and route the cables for the motherboard and other parts.
7. Install the GPU (if applicable)
Insert the GPU into the PCIe slot on the motherboard and screw it in.
8. Connect Cables
Plug in the power cables for the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and storage.
Attach any case fans and front-panel connectors.
9. Power On and Install Operating System
Connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Power on the computer.
Use a USB drive to install the OS
            </ul>

            <p>A computer is composed of a number of basic parts that cooperate to process information and carry out operations. The central processing unit, or CPU, serves as the computer's "brain," carrying out computations and executing commands. The motherboard, a circuit board that connects all the parts and enables effective communication, is attached to it. RAM, or memory, makes multitasking easier and faster by temporarily storing data that the CPU needs to access quickly.</p>

            <p>Data and files, including the operating system and software programs, are permanently stored on storage devices such as hard disks or solid-state drives. The power supply unit ensures steady power by distributing electricity to every component of the computer. Cooling devices, like fans and heatsinks, prevent overheating by regulating temperature during intensive use. Graphics processing units are responsible for rendering visuals, which is essential for tasks like gaming and graphic design.</p>

            <p>Lastly, data presentation and user interaction are enabled via input and output devices. Output devices, such as printers and monitors, display or print results, while input devices like keyboards and mice allow users to send commands to the computer. Some computers also feature optical drives that can read and write CDs or DVDs. Together, these components create a responsive and interactive system that supports modern computing tasks.</p>
