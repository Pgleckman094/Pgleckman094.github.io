    What is a Computer?
<p>
    A computer is a device that has the ability to store, process, and retrieve information. Computers may be programmed to carry out a variety of activities by using instructions that are stored in their memory.

    <ul>
        <li>Input: Computers accept data from the user</li>
        <li>
            Process: Computers use the data to perform calculations and other operations 
        </li>
        <li>
            Output: Computers produce information based on the processed data 
        </li>
        <li>
            Storage: Computers save the processed information for future use 
        </li>
    </ul>
